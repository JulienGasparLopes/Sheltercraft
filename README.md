# Survivalist

A minecraft mod aiming to provide a more challenging early-game survival experience by bringing back some features of older mods.

I decided to create this mod as most of the "early-game survival" mods are currently abandoned and outdated.

## Features

- Flint chipping and early-game flint tools
- Gathering logs now requires an axe
- Cutting Stump to transform logs into planks (planks recipes are disabled)

## References and Information

Here is a list of the mods and modpacks that inspired this mod:
- [Modpack] Sevtech
- Primal Core
- Primal Tech
- Horse Power

## License

If you are interested in using this mod in your own modpack, you are free to do so. I'll be glad to hear about your work !

All code is original and free of right (license coming soon).

Be aware that for developing purposes, some textures were retrieved from other mods. This is only temporary, and will be replaced by original textures in the future. Do NOT use these textures in your own mod.

## Development

For any question, suggestion or issue, feel free to open an issue.

Here is a quick list of the next features I plan to add:
- Improve CuttingStump to add a cooldown + number of axe hits before the log is transformed into planks.
- PlantFiber from grass and wovening (bamboo will also be usable).
- WickerBasket to store items (early-game storage).
- FlintPickaxe harvests only boulders, no cobblestone.
