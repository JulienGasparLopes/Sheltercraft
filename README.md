Here is a quick list of the next features I plan to add:
- Deactivate wood and stone tools recipes in crafting table.
- FlintPickaxe harvests only boulders, no cobblestone.
- Sieving to gather more flints from gravel.
- From sieves, gather natural sharpening stones (novaculite ?) to improve flint tools.
