# Survivalist

A minecraft mod aiming to provide a more challenging early-game survival experience by bringing back some features of older mods.

I decided to create this mod as most of the "early-game survival" mods are currently abandoned and outdated.

## Compatibility

- Minecraft version: 1.21.8
- Forge version: 58.0.4

## Features

- Flint chipping (right click on top of a stone block) and early-game flint tools
- Gathering logs now requires an axe (Flint Hatchet before log harvesting)
- Sticks may be gathered from leaves
- Cutting Stump to transform logs into planks and planks into sticks (planks and sticks recipes are disabled)

## References and Information

Here is a list of the mods and modpacks that inspired this mod:
- [Modpack] Sevtech
- Primal Core
- Primal Tech
- Horse Power

## License

If you are interested in using this mod in your own modpack, you are free to do so. I'll be glad to hear about your work !

All code/textures/models are original and free of right (license coming soon).

## Development

For any question, suggestion or issue, feel free to open an issue.

Here is a quick list of the next features I plan to add:
- PlantFiber from grass and wovening (bamboo will also be usable).
- WickerBasket to store items (early-game storage).
- FlintPickaxe harvests only boulders, no cobblestone.
- Sieving to gather more flints from gravel.
- From sieves, gather natural sharpening stones (novaculite ?) to improve flint tools.
