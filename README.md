This mod is developed in order to be integrated into a modpack I'll be working on as soon as this mod is stable enough.

Here is a quick list of the next features I plan to add:

#### User Journey Guide

- Add a basic advancement page to help using mod in standalone mode

#### Leather Working

- Retrieve rawhide from animals
- Craft rawhide into leather (salt+walter, drying, tan+water, drying, beating)
- New tools and machines: RawhideKnife, LeatherWorkerHammer, TanningTub, DryingRack
- For IronAge: wooden tanningTub to have 4 rawhide at same time (4x less water and faster)
- For mod integration: possibility to automate using create Press + WindTurbine

#### Pottery

- Still in early design phase
- May be needed for leather working (early tanning tub)

#### Cooking and Food balancing

- Still in early design phase
- Make early food sources scarcer
- Make cooking more important (bonuses ? Meals to stack bonuses ?)
- Do not make it too complex

#### Copper and Bronze Age

- Still in early design phase
- Unlock copper tools and maybe bronze tools
- Make iron a mid-game resource
